### **Important Notes**:
C++ may look similar if coming from Java or Python background, but, it is very vast & deep when comes to competitive coding, working on real-time systems. Version increments are as follows: ` C++ 11 included Lambda, NullPtr, RValue; C++ 14 included Templating, Generalised Lambda; C++ 17 included Fold expressions; C++ 20 included CoRoutines, Modules `. We can use C code into CPP as shown below. ` const ` is a qualifier which makes variable unchangable.

```cpp
#include <cstdio> // header file includes api's
using namespace std; // means std module is getting used std::cout

int main() {
    puts("Click on the button !");
    return 0;
}
```
